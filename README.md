# Data-Visualization

Experimenting and learning the basics of numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. Goal was to familiarize myself with numpy array functions, pandas objects such as Series and DataFrames, and learning to create graphs using matplotlib. Intended to provide as basic knowledge before experimenting with scikit learn and using these tools to help me better visualize data for machine learning models and applications.
